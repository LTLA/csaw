# The first specifies which features are wholly or partially overlapped by the current range.
# The second specifies what features are within 'tol' of the 5' end of the incoming region.
# The last specifies what features are within 'tol' of the 3' end of the incoming region.
# Promoters and exons are included. 
# If there are multiple overlaps, the first and last exon matching is shown.
