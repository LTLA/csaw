#' Control the empirical FDR
#' 
#' Control the empirical FDR across clusters for comparisons to negative controls, 
#' based on tests that are significant in the \dQuote{wrong} direction.
#' 
#' @param ids Integer vector containing the cluster ID for each test.
#' @param tab A data.frame of results with \code{PValue} and at least one \code{logFC} field for each test.
#' @param weights A numeric vector of weights for each window, defaults to 1 for each test.
#' @param pval.col An integer scalar or string specifying the column of \code{tab} containing the p-values.
#' @param fc.col An integer scalar or string specifying the column of \code{tab} containing the log-fold changes.
#' @param neg.down A logical scalar indicating if negative log-fold changes correspond to the \dQuote{wrong} direction.
#' 
#' @details
#' Some experiments involve comparisons to negative controls where there should be no signal/binding.
#' In such case, genuine differences should only occur in one direction, i.e., up in the non-control samples.
#' Thus, the number of significant tests that change in the wrong direction can be used as an estimate of the number of false positives.
#' 
#' This function converts two-sided p-values in \code{tab[,pval.col]} to one-sided counterparts in the wrong direction.
#' It combines the one-sided p-values for each cluster using \code{\link{combineTests}}.
#' The number of significant clusters at some p-value threshold represents the estimated number of false positive clusters.
#' 
#' The same approach is applied for one-sided p-values in the right direction, where the number of detected clusters at the threshold represents the total number of discoveries.
#' Dividing the number of false positives by the number of discoveries yields the empirical FDR at each p-value threshold.
#' Monotonicity is enforced (i.e., the empirical FDR only decreases with decreasing p-value) as is the fact that the empirical FDR must be below unity.
#' 
#' The p-values specified in \code{pval.col} are assumed to be originally computed from some two-sided test,
#' where the distribution of p-values is the same regardless of the direction of the log-fold change (under both the null and alternative hypothesis).
#' This rules out p-values computed from ANODEV where multiple contrasts are tested at once;
#' or from methods that yield asymmetric p-value distributions, e.g., GLM-based TREAT.
#' 
#' @section Caution:
#' Control of the empirical FDR is best used for very noisy data sets where the BH method is not adequate.
#' The BH method only protects against statistical false positives under the null hypothesis that the log-fold change is zero.
#' However, the empirical FDR also protects against experimental false positives, caused by non-specific binding that yields uninteresting (but statistically significant) DB.
#' 
#' The downside is that the empirical FDR calculation relies on the availability of a good estimate of the number of false positives.
#' It also assumes that the distribution of p-values is the same for non-specific binding events in both directions 
#' (i.e., known events with negative log-FCs and unknown events among those with positive log-FCs).
#' Even if the log-fold changes are symmetric around zero, this does not mean that the p-value distributions will be the same,
#' due to differences in library size and number between control and ChIP samples.
#' 
#' In summary, the BH method in \code{\link{combineTests}} is more statistically rigorous and should be preferred for routine analyses.

#' @return
#' A \linkS4class{DataFrame} with one row per cluster and various fields:
#' \itemize{
#' \item An integer field \code{num.tests}, specifying the total number of tests in each cluster.
#' \item Two integer fields \code{num.up.*} and \code{num.down.*} for each log-FC column in \code{tab}, containing the number of tests with log-FCs significantly greater or less than 0, respectively.
#' See \code{?"\link{cluster-direction}"} for more details.
#' \item A numeric field containing the cluster-level p-value. 
#' If \code{pval.col=NULL}, this column is named \code{PValue}, otherwise its name is set to \code{colnames(tab[,pval.col])}.
#' \item A numeric field \code{FDR}, containing the empirical FDR corresponding to that cluster's p-value.
#' \item A character field \code{direction} (if \code{fc.col} is of length 1), specifying the dominant direction of change for tests in each cluster.
#' See \code{?"\link{cluster-direction}"} for more details.
#' \item One integer field \code{rep.test} containing the row index (for \code{tab}) of a representative test for each cluster.
#' See \code{?"\link{cluster-direction}"} for more details.
#' \item One numeric field \code{rep.*} for each log-FC column in \code{tab}, containing a representative log-fold change for the differential tests in the cluster.
#' See \code{?"\link{cluster-direction}"} for more details.
#' }
#' Each row is named according to the ID of the corresponding cluster.
